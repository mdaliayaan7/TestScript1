I have a solid understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs), including their architecture, capabilities, and applications in tasks like natural language processing, text generation, and chatbots. While I haven’t directly worked on implementing or fine-tuning an LLM, I’m eager to apply my knowledge and quickly adapt to hands-on work with these models."
